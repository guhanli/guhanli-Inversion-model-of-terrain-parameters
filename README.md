main.cpp - The main program
PSO.cpp - Particle swarm optimization algorithm
Fitness.h - Computational fitness (hydrodynamic simulation error)
HydrodynamicModel.cpp - Hydrodynamic model main program, can be realized here hydrodynamic model call.You can use hydrodynamic simulation software such as MIKE, or write your own program to achieve hydrodynamic simulation.
terrain.txt,  optimized conditions.txt, optimized sequence.txt are the required model input file.
data.xlsx contains the monitoring data required for the hydrodynamic simulation. Because the data is confidential, only one day's data is available.
