# guhanli-Inversion-model-of-terrain-parameters
main.cpp - The main program
PSO.cpp - Particle swarm optimization algorithm
Fitness.h - Computational fitness (hydrodynamic simulation error)
HydrodynamicModel.cpp - The program of hydrodynamic model.For questions about the hydrodynamic model, contact the author.
terrain.txt,  optimized conditions.txt, optimized sequence.txt are the required model input file.
data.xlsx contains the monitoring data required for the hydrodynamic simulation. Because the data is confidential, only one day's data is available.
